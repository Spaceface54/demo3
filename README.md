Gameplay/Experience requirements
- The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player: The game continously tracks the location of the mouse, and discreetly checks if the mouse is pressed.
- The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact): the goal can oly be achived by the needle striking the ballon.
- 3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).
Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes: Levels 1, 2, and 3 are all physics scenes implimented in one phaser scene, separated with win screens.
